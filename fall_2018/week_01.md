## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I'v been getting familiar with c# and unity, specifically exploring the unity software. I've also been discussing with my teammates to know more the entire process.

## This Week's Plan

Next week, I am planning to do more research, and start practicing on small projects and design choices.

## Anything Blocking?

I have some confusion on how to achieve the project goal overall. This needs to be discussed with my team members more thoroughly.
