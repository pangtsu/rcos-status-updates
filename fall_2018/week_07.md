Last Week's Accomplishmentsï¼š 
I worked on adding player control functionality to the game, such as picking up/dropping items, jumping and flying (somehow the character is not constraint to the z axis and the ground layer)
I also wrote scripts to display an item in infinite rotation

This Week's Plan: I'm planning to fix the bugs in my code so the character would be constraint to z axis and ground layer
