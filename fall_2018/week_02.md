Last Week's Accomplishmentsï¼š
Last week, we as a group requested for the floor plan from the bookstore. We got an approval but we still haven't gotten it yet.
The front end of the team has also initialized a website.

This Week's Plan:
Continue practicing on Unity, asking for permissions, etc.

Anything Blocking?
Mostly technical issues. Since I'm new to everything, it takes some time to catch up with the others.
