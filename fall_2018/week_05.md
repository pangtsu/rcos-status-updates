Last Week's Accomplishmentsï¼š 
Last week, I worked on stuffing in furnitures in the scene. I completed the lounge and main entrance section of the bookstore, and i'm looking into deal with the cashier section the following week. This is a really long process and can't be 100% completed within this semester.

This Week's Plan: I'm planning to look into adding sound effects, linking the objects with the purchase website, etc while working on putting in more furnitures along the way.
